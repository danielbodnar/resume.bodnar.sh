bio = """A full stack software engineer, sysadmin, platforms engineer and cloud architect who has been building web applications since February of 2000. My greatest strength isn't my current knowledge or prior experience, but my ability to quickly grasp new concepts by diving into the deep end and bringing order out of chaos. I've spent my career refusing to stay in one lane—my expertise spans the entire software engineering ecosystem, from low-level systems programming and infrastructure automation to application development and enterprise architecture. This breadth lets me identify solutions that specialists confined to a single domain cannot. I thrive in fast-paced environments that demand continual learning, and I enjoy identifying abstract connections. This has served me well in high-pressure situations where understanding root cause quickly means the difference between a minor incident and a major outage."""
